### Stop conditions

This modules uses three different stopping conditions. Given a number `e > 0` (called tolerance) we have:
  1. Difference between two successive approximations: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?O_t=\text { Onset event at time bin } t " />
  2. Relative difference between two successive approximations
  3. Residue
### Methods
