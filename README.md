## Methods

1. Bisection [+info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method)
2. *Regula falsi* [+info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_position_method)
3. Secant [+info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_method)
4. Newton-Rahpson [+info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method)
5. Fixed-point iteration
   [+info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_iteration). This method
    returns the fixed point if it's found in the interval, not the zero of
     the function. 
6. Steffensen [+info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffensen%27s_method)
